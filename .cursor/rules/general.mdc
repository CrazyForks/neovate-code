## General

- This is a node cli project.
- Don't be lazy, write all the code to implement features I ask for.
- Keep a log of what, why and how you did what you did in ".llms/fyi.md". Keep it updated.

## File Structure

- src/: Source code.

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript.
- File names should be in lowercase with dash separators.
- Api, commands and config in README.md should be ordered alphabetically.
- Test. 1) Use vitest for test cases, not jest. 2) Test cases should be in the same file as the code that is being tested. e.g. `foo.test.ts` for `foo.ts`.
